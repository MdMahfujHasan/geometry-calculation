    <br>
    <p class="text-slate-700 font-medium">DOM stands for Document Object Model, and it is a programming interface for
        HTML and XML
        documents. It
        represents
        the web page as a structured hierarchy of objects, allowing developers to interact with the page dynamically and
        manipulate its content, structure, and style.
        <br>
        <br>
        The purpose of DOM is to provide a standardized way for developers to access, navigate, and modify the content
        of web pages. By providing a tree-like structure of objects representing elements, attributes, and text nodes in
        a document, the DOM enables developers to write scripts that can change the content and appearance of a web page
        in response to user actions or other events.
        <br>
        <br>
        The DOM also enables developers to create and remove elements dynamically, add or remove classes and styles, and
        manipulate attributes such as the value of form fields or the source of an image. This makes it possible to
        create interactive web applications that can respond to user input and update the content of a page.

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-800">How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p class="text-slate-700 font-medium">To select HTML elements using the DOM, you can use the following methods:
        <br><br>
    <ol class="text-slate-700 font-medium">
        <li>
            document.getElementById(): This method selects an element based on its ID attribute.
            <br>
            For example: var element = document.getElementById('myId');
        </li>
        <li>
            document.getElementsByClassName(): This method selects elements based on their class name.
            <br>
            For example: var elements = document.getElementsByClassName('myClass');
        </li>
        <li>
            document.getElementsByTagName(): This method selects elements based on their tag name.
            <br>
            For example: var elements = document.getElementsByTagName('div');
        </li>
        <li>
            document.querySelector(): This method selects the first element that matches a specified CSS selector.
            <br>
            For example: var element = document.querySelector('#myId .myClass');
        </li>
        <li>
            document.querySelectorAll(): This method selects all elements that match a specified CSS selector.
            <br>
            For example: var elements = document.querySelectorAll('div.myClass');
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <span class="text-slate-700 font-medium">Once you have selected an element, you can then use various properties and
        methods provided by the DOM to
        manipulate it. For example, you can set the element's text content with the textContent property, or modify its
        CSS styles using the style property.</span></p>
    <br>
    <span class="text-slate-700 font-medium"></span>
    <ol class="text-slate-700 font-medium">
        <li>getElementById(): Selects an element based on its ID attribute.</li>
        <li>getElementsByClassName(): Selects elements based on their class name.</li>
        <li>getElementsByTagName(): Selects elements based on their tag name.</li>
        <li>querySelector(): Selects the first element that matches a specified CSS selector.</li>
        <li>querySelectorAll(): Selects all elements that match a specified CSS selector.</li>
        <li>createElement(): Creates a new HTML element.</li>
        <li>appendChild(): Appends a child element to a parent element.</li>
        <li>removeChild(): Removes a child element from a parent element.</li>
        <li>setAttribute(): Sets the value of an attribute on an element.</li>
        <li>getAttribute(): Gets the value of an attribute on an element.</li>
        <li>addEventListener(): Attaches an event listener to an element.</li>
        <li>removeEventListener(): Removes an event listener from an element.</li>
        <li>innerHTML: Gets or sets the HTML content of an element.</li>
        <li>innerText or textContent: Gets or sets the text content of an element.</li>
        <li>style: Gets or sets the CSS styles of an element.</li>
        <li>classList: Gets or sets the CSS classes of an element.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-800">What is event bubble?</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="text-slate-700 font-medium">Event bubbling is a phenomenon in the Document Object Model (DOM) where an
        event that
        occurs on an element inside
        another element is also triggered on the parent elements of the inner element, propagating up the DOM tree. This
        means that when an event occurs on a nested element, such as a button inside a div, the event will also trigger
        on the parent element of the button (in this case, the div).
        <br>
        <br>
        This bubbling up of events can be both useful and problematic. It can be useful because it allows you to capture
        an event on a parent element and handle it for all of its child elements without having to attach event
        listeners to each child element individually. However, it can also be problematic because it can cause
        unintended side effects or conflicts with other event handlers.
        <br>
        <br>
        To prevent event bubbling, you can use the event.stopPropagation() method in your event handler function. This
        method stops the propagation of the event to the parent elements, allowing you to handle the event exclusively
        on the target element.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold  text-blue-800">What is a callback function and why should you use it?</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="text-slate-700 font-medium">A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another
        function and is
        called within that
        function. The purpose of using a callback function is to allow the called function to execute some code or
        perform some action on the data that is passed to it. The callback function is called once the data has been
        processed, and its result can then be used by the calling function.
        <br>
        <br>
        The advantages of using a callback function include:
    <ol class="text-slate-700 font-medium">
        <li>Modularity: Callback functions allow for modular programming by separating concerns and keeping the code
            more
            organized and easier to understand.
        </li>
        <li>
            Asynchronous Operations: Callback functions are often used in asynchronous programming, where a function
            needs
            to wait for some external process to complete before it can continue. The callback function is called once
            the
            external process is complete, allowing the main function to continue execution.
        </li>
        <li>Reusability: Callback functions can be reused in different contexts, making the code more versatile and
            easier
            to maintain.
        </li>
        <li>
            Event Handling: Callback functions are often used to handle events in web development, such as button
            clicks,
            mouse movements, and keyboard inputs. The callback function is triggered when the event occurs, allowing the
            code to respond to user input.
        </li>
        <li>
            Overall, callback functions are a powerful tool in modern programming, and their use can greatly improve
            code
            efficiency, modularity, and organization.
        </li>
    </ol>
